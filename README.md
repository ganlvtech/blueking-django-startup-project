You may find that Blueking's default Django project has too many unused things and difficult to learn.

The repo gives you a `settings.py`. It will make a pure django project runs on Blueking Cloud Platform.

You can also clone this repo as a startup project or demo project. But what you may need is only that `settings.py`.

## Getting Started

1. Create a new django project

    ```bash
    django-admin startproject mysite
    cd mysite/
    ```

2. Get this `settings.py` script

    ```bash
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ganlvtech/blueking-django-startup-project/master/settings.py
    ```

3. Change `manage.py` `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE`

    ```python
    os.environ.setdefault("DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE", "settings")
    ```

4. Change `settings.py` `mysite` to `yoursite`

    ```python
    from mysite.settings import *
    ```

5. Run server

    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

6. You don't need to install `MySQL-python` locally. Try `PyMySQL`, which can be easily installed with pip.

    ```bash
    pip install PyMySQL
    ```

7. If you need to install some other packages with pip on the server, just add them to `requirements.txt`. The auto deploy script will do `pip install -r requirements.txt` before running the application.

## Run This Demo Project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ganlvtech/blueking-django-startup-project.git
pip install django==1.8.3
pip install PyMySQL
```

Edit `mysite/settings.py` and `mysite/secrets.py`.

```bash
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```

### Use Celery

```bash
pip install celery==3.1.18
pip install django-celery==3.2.1
```

You can see the following lines at the end of `mysite/settings.py`.

```python
import djcelery  # NOQA
djcelery.setup_loader()
INSTALLED_APPS += ('djcelery',)
BROKER_URL = 'django://'
INSTALLED_APPS += ('kombu.transport.django',)
CELERYBEAT_SCHEDULER = 'djcelery.schedulers.DatabaseScheduler'
```

And then run migration.

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

Start celery workers and celery beat

```bash
python manage.py celery worker
python manage.py celery beat
```

> `celery beat` loads periodic tasks from database and sends the tasks to worker.
>
> Celery beat doesn't do the work itself. So even if you only need periodic task, you must start one worker at least.
>
> If you don't need periodic task, remove `CELERYBEAT_SCHEDULER` from `settings.py`.

## About Blueking Platform

It's just a Django Docker container!

You can do everything you want.

There must be a `settings.py` in root directory, because `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` is set to `settings` from container's environment variables.

Blueking Django Framework provide lots of modules helping DevOps, such as traffic analyser, mailer, sms sender, logger, QQ login, permission control and Mako template engine. They are too heavy. A normal web application may not need them.

If your are new to Django, this simple `settings.py` won't make you confused. Just adding one file to your project makes Django official tutorial available for Blueking platform. Hope this could help you.

You can write them or migrate them by yourself when you are good enough in Django programming.

### Notes

`setuptools` is at version `11`. Some packages (e.g. `PyMySQL`) require `setuptools` version `30`. But the auto deploy script won't update `setuptools`. So PyMySQL cannot be easily installed.
